# Flask Lease Notice Generator

This Flask application provides a web-based interface to generate a two-page "Notice to Pay Rent or Vacate" and "Affidavit of Service" for North Carolina. It features a live preview that updates as you fill out the form, a digital signature pad, and generates a downloadable PDF of the final notice.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form**: A comprehensive form to capture all necessary details for the eviction notice, including landlord, tenant, rent, and service information.
- **Live Preview**: A real-time preview of the two-page notice that updates instantly as you type.
- **Digital Signature Pad**: A smooth, responsive signature pad (powered by `SignaturePad.js`) to capture a digital signature. The signature is embedded in the final PDF.
- **Two-Page PDF Generation**: Generates a complete, two-page PDF document containing both the "Notice to Pay Rent or Vacate" and the "Affidavit of Service".
- **Placeholder Support**: The live preview displays placeholder lines for empty fields and shows a default signature image before one is drawn.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, two-column layout with the form on one side and the live preview on the other.
